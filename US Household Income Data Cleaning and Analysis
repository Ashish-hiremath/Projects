US Household Income Data Cleaning and Analysis

Overview

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the US Household Income dataset. The dataset includes household income statistics across different states, counties, and cities. The SQL scripts perform data cleaning, standardization, and EDA to improve data quality and extract insights.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key attributes:

ID: Unique identifier for each record.

State Name: Name of the state.

County: County name.

City: City or place name.

Type: Classification such as Borough, City, etc.

Mean & Median Household Income: Income statistics.

Aland & Awater: Land and water area measurements.

Income Brackets: Income distribution across different levels.

Population Statistics: Data on total and median household populations.

SQL Scripts Overview

1️⃣ Data Cleaning

The data cleaning script includes:

Fixing Column Names: Removing encoding issues.

Removing Duplicates: Identifying and deleting duplicate records.

Standardizing State Names: Correcting inconsistencies (e.g., georia → Georgia).

Correcting City Names: Ensuring consistency across place names.

Fixing Data Types: Ensuring proper numerical and text formats.

✅ Steps Performed

-- Use the database
USE analystbuilder;

-- Check tables
SHOW TABLES;

-- View sample data
SELECT * FROM ushouseholdincome LIMIT 100;

-- Fix column name encoding issue
ALTER TABLE ushouseholdincome_statistics
CHANGE COLUMN `ï»¿id` `id` INT;

-- Identify duplicate records
SELECT ID, COUNT(ID) FROM ushouseholdincome
GROUP BY ID
HAVING COUNT(ID) > 1;

-- Delete duplicate records
DELETE FROM ushouseholdincome
WHERE row_id IN (
    SELECT row_id FROM (
        SELECT row_id, id,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY id) AS row_num
        FROM ushouseholdincome
    ) AS duplicates
    WHERE row_num > 1
);

-- Standardize state names
UPDATE ushouseholdincome SET state_name = 'Georgia' WHERE state_name = 'georia';
UPDATE ushouseholdincome SET state_name = 'Alabama' WHERE state_name = 'alabama';

-- Standardize place names
UPDATE ushouseholdincome SET place = 'Autaugaville' WHERE city = 'Vinemont';

-- Fix type classifications
UPDATE ushouseholdincome SET type = 'Borough' WHERE type = 'Boroughs';

-- Check missing land and water area data
SELECT aland, awater FROM ushouseholdincome
WHERE aland = 0 OR awater = 0 OR awater IS NULL OR aland IS NULL;

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA script provides insights into land area, water area, and income statistics across states.

✅ Key Insights

Top 10 States by Total Land Area:

SELECT state_name, SUM(aland) AS total_land, SUM(awater) AS total_water
FROM ushouseholdincome
GROUP BY state_name
ORDER BY total_land DESC
LIMIT 10;

Top 10 States by Total Water Area:

SELECT state_name, SUM(aland) AS total_land, SUM(awater) AS total_water
FROM ushouseholdincome
GROUP BY state_name
ORDER BY total_water DESC
LIMIT 10;

Average Mean and Median Household Income by State:

SELECT u.state_name, ROUND(AVG(mean), 1), ROUND(AVG(median), 1)
FROM ushouseholdincome u
JOIN ushouseholdincome_statistics us
    ON u.id = us.id
WHERE mean != 0
GROUP BY u.state_name;

Income Distribution by State:

SELECT state_name, 
       ROUND(AVG(income_bracket_1), 2) AS low_income,
       ROUND(AVG(income_bracket_2), 2) AS middle_income,
       ROUND(AVG(income_bracket_3), 2) AS high_income
FROM ushouseholdincome_statistics
GROUP BY state_name
ORDER BY middle_income DESC;

Population vs Household Income Correlation:

SELECT state_name, 
       ROUND(AVG(income_bracket_1), 2) AS low_income,
       ROUND(AVG(income_bracket_2), 2) AS middle_income,
       ROUND(AVG(income_bracket_3), 2) AS high_income
FROM ushouseholdincome_statistics
GROUP BY state_name
ORDER BY middle_income DESC;
