World Life Expectancy Data Cleaning and Analysis

Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts for cleaning and analyzing the World Life Expectancy dataset. The scripts perform data cleaning, handle missing values, remove duplicates, and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). This README provides an overview of the dataset processing, key insights, and usage instructions.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains life expectancy data for various countries across multiple years. Key attributes include:

Country: Name of the country.

Year: Year of the recorded data.

Life Expectancy: Average life expectancy at birth.

GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita.

Status: Whether a country is Developed or Developing.

SQL Scripts Overview

The repository includes the following SQL scripts:

1️⃣ Data Cleaning

The data cleaning script performs the following:

Duplicate Removal: Identifies and deletes duplicate records based on country and year.

Handling Missing Values:

Missing status values are updated based on country classification.

Missing life expectancy values are interpolated using the average of the previous and next years.

Ensuring Consistency:

Standardizes country names and status values.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA script generates insights from the cleaned dataset, including:

Minimum and Maximum Life Expectancy per Country

Life Expectancy Change Over Time

Average Life Expectancy by Year

GDP vs Life Expectancy Analysis

Comparing High vs Low GDP Countries

Key Findings

Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher life expectancy.

Life expectancy has generally increased over time, with noticeable improvements in developing countries.

There are significant regional disparities in life expectancy.
